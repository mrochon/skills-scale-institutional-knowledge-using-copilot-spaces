# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation. This repository contains comprehensive guides and processes used by OctoAcme to manage projects effectively from initiation through delivery and continuous improvement.

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme follows a structured yet iterative approach to project management, built on these core principles:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritizing customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Delivering small, testable increments to reduce risk and gather feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead roles
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measuring impact and iterating based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encouraging feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

### Project Lifecycle

OctoAcme projects follow a five-phase lifecycle:

1. **Initiation** - Validate business need, align stakeholders, and create lightweight project charter
2. **Planning** - Break work into actionable backlog items, estimate scope, and define release plan
3. **Execution & Tracking** - Build, test, review, and iterate with regular standups and progress monitoring
4. **Release & Deployment** - Deploy validated features, verify functionality, and announce to stakeholders
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** - Capture learnings, celebrate successes, and identify improvements

### Key Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)** - Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)** - Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers** - Implement features and collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing** - Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders** - Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals

### Communication Cadence

- Weekly sync between PM and PdM
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery teams
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed
